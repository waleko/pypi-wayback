**PyPI Wayback Machine** is a modern and simple tool to retrieve historical PyPI pages of any package at a specific date ‚Äî think of it as a next-gen version of `pypi-timemachine` but with added flexibility. Whether you're tracking down a past release or examining dependency changes, this tool has you covered.

## üöÄ Features

- **Access PyPI pages at any past date**
- **Dockerized for quick setup** 
- **Lightweight and performant**

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

### Docker
Quickly start the server using Docker:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/waleko/pypi-wayback
```

### Python
Alternatively, you can run it directly using Python:
```bash
pip install pypi-wayback
python -m pypi_wayback --port 8080
```

### Accessing a Package's Historical Page

Once the server is running, access the PyPI page of a package by navigating to the following URL:
